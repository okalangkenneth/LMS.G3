Project Description.
1.Introduction:								
The project is about developing a Learning Management System for Lexicon continuing education.

Students will be able to search this databse and teachers will be able to apply and also edit its contents in a simplified way.
3.Project description: 
The application will have a backend built using C# .NET and MVC Core , the database with Entity Framework, the Front-end using Bootstrap 4 and Javascript. The application will have an API that will intergrate with MVC Core web interface. We will develop an ER diagram that will help us determine the relationships between the entities.  
Adobe XD  will help us develop UX . With the different wireframes we will be able to visualize the different pages in the application and how they will be related to each other. We will be using Trello and SCRUB to manage the workflow of the project.
